The MySQL Synchroniser is a simple script written in PHP that can assist and automate the synchronisation of differences in table structures between two database servers.

Synchronisation is performed between a source database and a destination.


## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require sqonk/mysql-sync
```

## Disclaimer - (Common Sense)

Always backup the destination database prior to making any changes, this should go without saying.

## Usage

### Method 1: Using a JSON config file

First duplicate the sample json sync file provided the conf folder, call it something meanginful and enter the database details for both the source and destination databases.

``` json
{
	"source" : {
		"host" : "",
		"user" : "",
		"password" : "",
		"database" : "",
		"port" : "3306"
	},
	"dest" : {
		"host" : "",
		"user" : "",
		"password" : "",
		"database" : "",
		"port" : "3306"
	},
    "ignoreColumnWidths" : false
}
```

Then from your terminal run the following the command:

``` bash
vendor/bin/mysql-sync path/to/my/config-file.json
```

### Method 2: Using in-memory PHP array

Create a new PHP script, load the composer includes and pass your config array accordingly.

``` php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

mysql_sync([
    "source" => [
        "host" => "",
        "user" => "",
        "password" => "",
        "database" => "",
        "port" => "3306"
    ],
    "dest" => [
        "host" => "",
        "user" => "",
        "password" => "",
        "database" => "",
        "port" => "3306"
    ],
    "ignoreColumnWidths" => false
]);
```

#### Ignoring Column Widths

If you are in a situation in which the configuration of the destination database differs from that of the source environment in such a way that column widths do not match up then you can set the option `ignoreColumnWidths` to true in the sync configuration.

This will adjust the comparison to ignore column width/length.

### Process

A dry-run will first be performed and any differences will be displayed, including:

* New tables to create in the destination.
* Old tables to drop no longer present on the source.
* Tables present in both but with differing columns (including new, old and modified)

Once done, you will be prompted if you wish to apply the changes for real.
